# 💖 Support & Contact

Hi there! 👋 Thanks for checking out **GraphXML** 🚀  

I code **entirely on my phone 📱** — using **Termux** and **Cxxdroid** — since I don’t currently have a PC 💻.  
Even with these limitations, I keep building projects and developing this library. It’s not always easy, but I put in all my energy ⚡ because I believe it can be useful for the community.  

Your support helps me stay motivated, grow in open-source, and one day achieve my dream — to finally code on a real computer 🙏💻❤️
